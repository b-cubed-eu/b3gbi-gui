## Welcome to the B-Cubed General Biodiversity Indicators Graphical User Interface


This is a Shiny graphical front-end for the b3gbi R package (https://www.github.com/b-cubed-eu/b3gbi).

To use it, first install the latest version of the b3gbi package, then clone this repository using: 

<code>git clone https://www.github.com/b-cubed-eu/b3gbi-gui</code>

You can run the application from within RStudio by opening app.R and clicking the 'Run App' button in the top right corner of the coding window. You may need to first download some dependencies.

Upload a GBIF data cube (.csv file format) to the app and away you go. If you run into any trouble or the app stops responding, you can always click the 'Reload' button in the top right of the coding window or the red 'Stop' button in the top right of the console.
